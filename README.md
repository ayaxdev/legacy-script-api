### ScriptAPI v1 compatibility

This script re-introduces the compatibility layer for ScriptAPI v1, which was removed in LiquidBounce b83, while adding a few tweaks.

Only works on LiquidBounce **legacy**, *NOT* LiquidBounce nextgen.

**NEVER** contact LiquidBounce staff about errors while using legacy scripts!

For help and support, contact me on Discord: ayyyax.

#### How to install

1) Download the contents of this repository
2) Copy the contents into your LiquidBouce-1.8.9 folder
3) Insert your favourite legacy scripts in scriptapi-v1/scripts

#### Warnings

- Some scripts will simply not work. If that happens, try and contact me to sort out the issue.
- LiquidBounce will take longer to start up while using this script.
